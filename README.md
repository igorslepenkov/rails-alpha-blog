### About Project

This is my first small Ruby project, that I have created during my RoR internship at IThechArt company.

It includes only 4 models without any additional relations between them. Also it has custom authorization and authentication logic.

Front made with Bootstrap 5(but it wasn't the main purpose :) )

### Built With

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
